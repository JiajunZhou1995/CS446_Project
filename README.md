# CS446_Project

The project forms an integral part of this course. One requirement for the implementation of the app is that it should be a Native Android app (i.e., not built using an app builder or a framework like React/Node.js or HTML5). The two goals of the project is to

produce a significant mobile app that performs some useful function
have a defensible design and architecture that can be presented to us explicitly
There are only three soft restrictions on the app idea itself: no database management apps will be accepted (e.g., simple CRUD apps that do not make sense in a mobile context); apps that require crowd buy-in are not acceptable (e.g., apps that would require large numbers of people to contribute content to be viably useful); apps that require a complex server infrastructure are also not acceptable.

You must demo your app on an Android device. The library has Android devices that can be signed out. After the prototype demo we will provide a 'pivot' to each group; this will consist of a new or modified requirement for your app that you will have to include for the final demo (and write about in the architecture and design deliverable).

The projects will be completed in teams of three (and in special circumstances four). You are free to select your own team; if you do not have a team or your team has less than three members, please talk to me and I will set you up.

Project grades need not be the same for all team members. Each team member will get a score based on effort. Projects will have a difficulty scale applied to them by the instructor and TAs. The scale formula will be:

(project score for the team member + bonus) * scale = final project grade
Scale will range between 0.5 and 1.0. The components of the scaling mark will be determined by:
10: completeness (compared to proposal)
10: utility
10: polish
10: difficulty
10: pivot
There will also be various sources of bonus marks during the term; each will be worth 2%:
Best pitch
Best prototype demo
Best final demo
Accepted to the Google Play Store
NOTE: The expectation is that you will work approximately 12 hours per week on this course; at least 8 of these hours should be on the project. Given that the course lasts 13 weeks, each team member is expected to work on the project at least 100 hours. You should be able to accomplish something pretty great in this time; please make the most of this opportunity.
